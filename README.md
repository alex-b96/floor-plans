# Floor Plan Segmentation with U-Net

A deep learning project for semantic segmentation of floor plans using a U-Net architecture. This project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a U-Net model, and perform inference on architectural floor plan images.

## Features
- U-Net model implementation for image segmentation
- Training and inference scripts
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- Modular, clean Python code

## Project Structure
- `model.py` — U-Net model definition and related utilities
- `inference.py` — Script for running inference on new images
- `u-net.ipynb` — Main notebook for model training and evaluation
- `u-net-backbone.ipynb` — Notebook for backbone experiments or model variations
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/floor-plans.git
   cd floor-plans
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- **Training and experimentation:**
  Open `u-net.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and follow the cells to train and evaluate the model.
